Elite Dangerous Background Simulation Visualiser Redux

***ED Backviz Redux***

A tool for visualizing BGS data from Elite Dangerous. If you're like me and need a map to understand what's going on in the BGS, this is for you. Search for factions, track them, see the space they occupy, see conflicts, etc.
